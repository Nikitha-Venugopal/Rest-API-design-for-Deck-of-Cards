Design Description:

Assumptions:

1. It is assumed that there is a single user (user1) who owns several decks.

2. Each deck owned by the user is identified by its unique 'id'.

3. Every deck consists of set of cards and its information.

4. For the REST call which shows all the decks, the paginated results consist of 10 deck entries in each page.

5. For the REST call which shows the combined response, the paginated results consist of 5 deck entries in each page.

6. A singleton class is designed to build the Deck data. This class is used throughout to access the deck data.

NOTE: We can either use the browser or client like Postman to invoke the REST Services.

REST Calls to be made to get the desired output :

1.  GET /users/{username}/decks

	URL: localhost:8080/users/user1/decks

	Description:
		1. Here the userName is considered to be "user1". 
		2. This request will return the user with 10 entries.
		3. The response contains "nextPageToken" which indicates the next page number.
		4. Using the next page number as a part of the request, we can get the next pages using the next REST call.
		 
 2. GET /users/{username}/decks/{pageNumber}
 
 	URL: localhost:8080/users/user1/decks/2
 	
 	Description:
 		1. So the response to this query gives us the 2nd page results.
 		2. The "nextPageToken" again indicates the page number of next page if exists
 			or simply returns a value of '1' saying there are no more pages and the 
 			next page is the first page.
 			
 3. GET /decks/{id}
 
 	URL: localhost:8080/decks/1
 	
 	Description:
 		1. The above call returns the response for a specified deck based on its id.
 		2. This response contains the deckId, description and cards collection.
 		3. If an Id other than id's present is given, an Error message saying "The 
 			deck Id is not present" is returned to the user.

4.  GET /users/user1/decks/combinedResponse 		
	
    URL: localhost:8080/users/user1/decks/combinedResponse	
    
    Description:
		1. Here the userName is considered to be "user1". 
		2. This request will return the user with 5 deck entries.
		3. The response contains "nextPageToken" which indicates the next page number.
		4. Using the next page number as a part of the request, we can get the next pages using the next REST call.

5. 	GET /users/user1/decks/combinedResponse/{pageNumber} 		
	
    URL: localhost:8080/users/user1/decks/combinedResponse/2
    
    Description:
 		1. So the response to this query gives us the 2nd page results.
 		2. The "nextPageToken" again indicates the page number of next page if exists
 			or simply returns a value of '1' saying there are no more pages and the 
 			next page is the first page.
